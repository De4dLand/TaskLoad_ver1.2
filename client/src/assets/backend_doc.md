# Server-Side Technology Analysis for TaskLoad

## Overview

TaskLoad's backend is built on a modern Node.js stack with Express.js as the web framework. The application uses MongoDB for data storage, Redis for caching and session management, and implements JWT-based authentication. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the server-side technologies and their capabilities.

## Core Technologies

### 1. Express.js Framework

**Description**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

**Capabilities**:
- Routing system for handling HTTP requests
- Middleware architecture for request processing
- Support for various templating engines
- Error handling
- Static file serving

**Implementation in TaskLoad**:
- API routes are organized in the `/api/v1/` namespace
- Middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling
- JSON response formatting

### 2. MongoDB with Mongoose

**Description**: MongoDB is a NoSQL document database used for storing application data. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

**Capabilities**:
- Schema definition and validation
- Middleware for pre/post operations
- Query building and execution
- Population (joining) of related documents
- Indexing for performance optimization

**Models in TaskLoad**:
- User: Manages user accounts and authentication
- Task: Handles task creation, assignment, and tracking
- Project: Organizes tasks into projects
- Team: Manages team membership and collaboration

### 3. Redis

**Description**: Redis is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.

**Capabilities**:
- Caching for improved performance
- Session storage
- Rate limiting
- Pub/Sub messaging
- Task queues

**Implementation in TaskLoad**:
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Storing refresh tokens
- Rate limiting API requests

## Authentication System

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

**Description**: JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

**Capabilities**:
- Stateless authentication
- Token-based authorization
- Payload customization
- Expiration control

**Implementation in TaskLoad**:
- Access tokens with short expiration (1 hour)
- Refresh tokens with longer expiration (7 days)
- Token refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control
